# Webpack 5 Migration & Module Federation Setup

## Overview

In this phase, we successfully upgraded our build configuration to Webpack 5 to enable Module Federation capabilities. This was a crucial step in transforming our monolithic application into a micro-frontend architecture.

## Key Changes

### Webpack 5 Migration

- Upgraded from Webpack 4 to Webpack 5
- Retained existing optimization configurations
- Updated necessary loaders and plugins for compatibility
- Implemented enhanced build performance features

### Module Federation Configuration

- Established shared dependency management
- Created separate webpack configurations for:
  - Host application
  - Remote modules
- Implemented dynamic remote loading

## Architecture Changes

### Host Application

- Configured entry points for remote module loading
- Established shared scope management
- Implemented dynamic remote loading capabilities
- Set up container configuration

### Remote Applications

- Created independent build configurations
- Established exposed module definitions
- Implemented shared dependency alignment
- Set up standalone deployment capabilities
