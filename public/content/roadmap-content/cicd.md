# CI/CD Implementation & Build Configuration POC

## Overview

Established CI/CD pipelines for remote modules with AWS S3 integration, enabling versioned deployments and streamlined module consumption by the host application. Includes migration from Webpack 4 to Webpack 5 with updated build configurations.

## Implementation Details

### Build Configuration Updates

- Migrated build system from Webpack 4 to Webpack 5
- Implemented shared dependency management

### CI/CD Pipeline Structure

- Automated build process for each repository
- Versioned deployments to AWS S3 buckets
- Organized storage structure: `[repo-name]/[version]/*`
- Automated testing and quality checks (we keep this as is for now)

## Technical Architecture

### AWS Integration

- S3 bucket configuration for module storage
- Structured version management
- Public access configuration for remote modules
- CDN integration for optimized delivery

### Build Process

- Automated version tagging
- Build artifact optimization
- Environment-specific configurations

## Benefits

- Automated deployment workflow
- Version-controlled module management
- Simplified module consumption
- Reduced deployment errors
- Improved build performance

## AWS Configuration

- Bucket Structure: `/[repo-name]/[version]`
- Access Control: Public Read
- Resource Types: JS, CSS, Assets
- CDN: CloudFront Distribution
