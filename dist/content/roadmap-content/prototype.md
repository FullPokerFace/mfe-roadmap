# MFE Prototype

## Demo

The MFE prototype app is available [here](your-link-here)

## Overview

The main objective of this small prototype app was to create a webpack configuration with Micro Frontend (MFE) functionality to understand how it works behind the scenes, without including complex logic of our main application.

## Architecture

A small application concept was created with 3 distinct parts:

- **main-ui** - Acting as the host application
- **wallet-ui** - Implemented as a remote module
- **header-ui** - Implemented as a remote module

## Technical Implementation

We incorporated all essential parts that we use in our main application, including:

- Cross-dependency management
- State management using Redux
- Routing implementation
- SCSS styling
- Actions handling
- Middleware integration
